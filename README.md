In Einstein's theory of general relativity, gravity is treated as a phenomenon resulting from
the curvature of spacetime. This curvature is caused by the presence of mass. Generally, the
more mass that is contained within a given volume of space, the greater the curvature of
spacetime will be at the boundary of its volume. As objects with mass move around in
spacetime, the curvature changes to reflect the changed locations of those objects. In certain
circumstances, accelerating objects generate changes in this curvature, which propagate
outwards at the speed of light in a wave-like manner. These propagating phenomena are known
as gravitational waves.


 As a gravitational wave passes an observer, that observer will find spacetime distorted by
the effects of strain. Distances between objects increase and decrease rhythmically as the wave
passes, at a frequency corresponding to that of the wave. This occurs despite such free objects
never being subjected to an unbalanced force. The magnitude of this effect decreases
proportional to the inverse distance from the source. Inspiraling binary neutron stars are
predicted to be a powerful source of gravitational waves as they coalesce, due to the very large
acceleration of their masses as they orbit close to one another. However, due to the
astronomical distances to these sources, the effects when measured on Earth are predicted to
be very small, having strains of less than 1 part in 1020. Scientists have demonstrated the
existence of these waves with ever more sensitive detectors. The most sensitive detector
accomplished the task possessing a sensitivity measurement of about one part in 5×1022 (as of
2012) provided by the LIGO and VIRGO observatories. A space based observatory, the Laser
Interferometer Space Antenna , is currently under development by ESA.


 Gravitational waves can penetrate regions of space that electromagnetic waves cannot. They
are able to allow the observation of the merger of black holes and possibly other exotic objects
in the distant Universe. Such systems cannot be observed with more traditional means such
as optical telescopes or radio telescopes, and so gravitational-wave astronomy gives new
insights into the working of the Universe. In particular, gravitational waves could be of interest
to cosmologists as they offer a possible way of observing the very early Universe. This is not
possible with conventional astronomy, since before recombination the Universe was opaque to
electromagnetic radiation. Precise measurements of gravitational waves will also allow
scientists to test more thoroughly the general theory of relativity.


 In principle, gravitational waves could exist at any frequency. However, very low frequency
waves would be impossible to detect and there is no credible source for detectable waves of
very high frequency. Stephen Hawking and Werner Israel list different frequency bands for
gravitational waves that could plausibly be detected, ranging from 10−7 Hz up to 1011 Hz.
